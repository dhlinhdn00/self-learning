## DESCRIPTION

Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

We will use integers `0`, `1` and `2` to represent the color red, white and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

## EXAMPLE

### Example 1:

    Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
    Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

### Example 2:

    Input: nums = [2,0,1]
    Output: [0, 1, 2]

---

## CONTRAINTS

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 300`
- `nums[i] is either 0, 1 and 2`

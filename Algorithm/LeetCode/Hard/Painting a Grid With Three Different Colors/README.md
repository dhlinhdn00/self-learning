## DESCRIPTION

You are given two integers `m` and `n` grid where each cell is initially white. You can paint each cell **red**, **green** or **blue**. All cells **must** be painted.

Return the number of ways to color the grid with **no two adjacent cells having the same color**. Since the answer can be very large, return it **modulo** $10^9 + 7$

## EXAMPLE

### Example 1:

<p align="center">
    <img src="./colorthegrid.png" alt="example-1" />
</p>
    
    Input: m = 1, n = 1
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The three possible colorings are shown in the image above.

### Example 2:

<p align="center">
    <img src="./copy-of-colorthegrid.png" alt="example-2" />
</p>

    Input: m = 1, n = 2
    Output: 6
    Explanation: The six possible colorings are shown in the image above.

### Example 3:

    Input: m = 5, n = 5
    Output: 580986
